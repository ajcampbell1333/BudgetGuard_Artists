# BudgetGuard Artists - Python Dependencies
# 
# Note: ComfyUI provides most dependencies. This file lists any additional
# dependencies that BudgetGuard requires beyond ComfyUI's base installation.

# Future dependencies (for cost estimation and API integration):
# requests>=2.31.0  # For API calls to cloud providers
# cryptography>=41.0.0  # For credential encryption/decryption

# Currently, BudgetGuard works as a passthrough with no additional dependencies.
# Dependencies will be added as features are implemented.
